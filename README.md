#Eucalyptus

A week-long assignment in week 12 of the 16-week programming course at CodeClan. The aim was to consolidate and build upon what we had learned about React in a group project.

We chose to create a single page Content Management System, which displays a live preview of the userâ€™s website as they make changes. Eucalyptus was created using React for the front end, Express as the web server and MongoDB as the persistent data storage.
